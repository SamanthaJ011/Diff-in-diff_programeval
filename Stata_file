/* According to the coefficient on the interaction term between the year 2012
and being near the incinerator, housing prices fell an average of almost $12,700 dollars due to proximity to the incinerator. However, this coefficient is not statistically significant with a t-statistic of -1.37. This means that we cannot conclude that the incinerator had a significant effect on housing values within its proximity.*/

/* Adding controls for the age of the house, distance to the interstate, land area, house area, number of rooms, and number of baths brings the r-squared up from 0.1739 to 0.6403. The coefficient on y12*nearinc shows a decrease in housing prices near the
incinerator after it was built, however the standard error is more than half the
size of the coefficient, producing a t-statistic of -1.71. Therefore, the decrease
is not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level and cannot be
causally attributed to the construction of the incinerator. */
